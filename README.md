Created a simple tool to help analyze the strength of potential passwords
Running the python script will prompt for an input, it will analyze that input 
and determine how strong the password is on a scale of 1-5
The tool is not intended to create a password for you and is merely for demonstrative 
and educational purposes only. Nothing is encrypted so do not use this to store or 
important information or passwords
This tool could possibly be modified to malicously store a password the user put in, or 
falsly claim a password is strong when it isnt, eg: claiming "password" is a strength 5 password
however the intended use is to help the user understand what makes a password strong or or not.
